## Introduction and Motivation
Speckle tracking is the standard for surface strain/deformation measurement. Measurement strain and strain fields is essential for the proper characterization of a material's mechanical properties.

Voxel-based additive manufacturing allows researchers to 3D print random speckle patterns through the thickness of any material. Additive methods produce parts and assemblies with anisotropic mechanical properties. Furthermore, the highest resolution methods allow for the fabrication of micro-structures that further influence this anisotropic behavior.

To support the characterization efforts of said complex parts and assemblies, here we propose a method for the distribution and fabrication of printed speckles:
* Printed speckels can be distributed randomly along the surface and through the thickness of any input mesh
* The shape and size of the speckles can also be tuned to the user preference

## Installation Instructions
The Speckle Pattern Generator (SPG) was developed using [Houdini 17](https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/). The repository provides several versions of the **spg_v*.hipnc** file. Each version features distinct capabilities:
* **spg_v1**
* **spg_v2**
* **spg_v3**
* **spg_v4**
